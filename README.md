# Extended Asset Editor
Mod for Cities: Skylines

Uses slightly modified code from SamsamTS' Advanced Vehicle Options for some UI functions.

Update: 2021.02.24
Forked to try and fix for trams which haven't been working with the 
workshop build. But seems to be working without changes. Maybe it just
needed to be rebuilt against newer game libraries.
